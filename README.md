# teamX-copilot-project

This repository contains a minimal scaffold for a team classroom project (static web demo). The project is intentionally small — use it as a starting point for your team's To‑Do or notes app.

Try it locally

- Open `index.html` in your browser, OR
- Serve the folder and open http://localhost:8000:

```bash
# simple (Python 3) static server
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Files added by scaffold:

- `index.html` — demo UI and markup
- `style.css` — basic styling
- `app.js` — tiny client-side behavior (add/remove tasks)

Workflow notes

- Work on a feature branch (`feature/…`) and open a Pull Request to merge into `main`.
- Use the `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for guidance when using AI agents or Copilot to help generate code.

If you'd like a Node/Express scaffold instead, tell me and I'll generate it.
